<h2 class="hcls">Call for Posters</h2>


<p>
DEV 2015 provides an international forum for research in the design, implementation, and evaluation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for social and economic development. In particular, we focus on contexts where conventional computing solutions are often inappropriate due to various contextual factors - including, but not limited to: cost, language, literacy, and the availability of power and bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
The poster deadline for DEV 2015 is September 30th. Posters must not exceed 2 pages and all submissions must be in ACM format, submitted as a PDF. Submissions should be fully anonymised; In particular, the names or affiliations of authors should not be included so as to allow for blind review. Posters should be submitted via the submission site. Posters should describe original and previously unpublished research, innovative experiments, and work in progress. All DEV poster submissions should either provide or directly motivate a novel technical solution that has direct implications for development. 
</p>

<p>
The topic of ICT for development is inherently multidisciplinary, and encompasses a broad array of fields within the computer science discipline.  The ACM DEV conference is an opportunity for researchers across these diverse fields of computer science to come together to work on the common problem of improving access to and availability of information and communication technology solutions.  In an effort to encourage participation of researchers across the relevant domains, this year the conference focuses on research at the interface of computer science and development related to (but not limited to) the following non-exclusive focus areas:
</p>

<h3>Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low-cost connectivity and computing devices</li>
<li>Network solutions for poorly connected regions, including white space spectrum</li> 
<li>Power-efficient systems</li> 
<li>Mobile systems and applications</li> 
<li>Special-purpose systems, e.g., sensors, wireless, IVR</li> 
<li>Systems challenges and opportunities in development, e.g., security, sustainability, resilience</li> 
<li>Cellular phone systems and applications</li> 
<li>Novel tools and applications for development</li>
<li>Measurements of existing technology in developing regions (e.g. network deployments)</li>
</ul>

<h3>HCI</h2>
<ul>
<li>User interfaces for low-literacy populations</li>
<li>Multi-lingual computing</li>
<li>User interfaces for low-cost devices</li>
<li>Participatory methods and user-centered design</li>
<li>Accessibility to disabled populations in developing regions</li>
<li>Design and evaluation of applications in health, microfinance, education, agriculture, entertainment, social media</li>
<li>Adapting content and applications to local languages and education levels</li>
<li>Understanding social relationships and information flows in disadvantaged societies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computational sustainability</li>
<li>Computational social science</li>
<li>Econometric models and developmental economics</li>
<li>Data science for social good</li>
<li>Machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in development contexts</li>
<li>Speech interfaces and translation for low-resource languages</li>
<li>Computer vision challenges and opportunities in development</li>
<li>Understanding social networks and digital media in developing regions</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In addition, we welcome posters outside of the above topics that address the DEV focus on computing innovations supporting social and economic development.
</p>

<p>
	The accepted posters will be published in the companion conference proceedings.
