<h2 class="hcls">Submissions</h2>

<p>
SIGCOMM is a highly selective conference where full papers typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. Submissions can be up to 14 pages in length, in two-column 10pt format. . The submission instructions will be posted here in some time. Note that accepted camera-ready papers will be 12 pages in length, in two-column format with 9pt font.
</p>
<p>
This year, authors will have the option of submitting a short rebuttal of the reviews of their paper after the first round of reviewing has concluded. The goal of the rebuttal process is to allow authors the opportunity to correct misperceptions, if any, regarding their paper. Note that submitting a rebuttal is entirely optional.
</p>

<p>In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2012 will have a series of co-located workshops, a poster and demo session, a travel grant program, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.
