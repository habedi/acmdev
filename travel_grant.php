<h2 class="hcls">Student Travel Grants</h2>

<p>
This year, as in years past, the Conference Organizing Committee is working hard to provide as much travel support to as many conference attendees as possible. Travel support has been provided from many different supporting organizations. Through this support, we will be able to assist dozens of attendees.
</p>

<p>
Support is provided for a variety of different types of attendees, from graduate students to post-doctoral scholars. The amount of support depends on the type of attendee and available funding. Attendees from around the world are encouraged to apply.
</p>

<p>
Support for SIGCOMM 2012 from the following organizations has been confirmed:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
ISOC Latin America Chapter funding is available for applicants from Latin American and Caribbean institutions.
</li>

<li>
Euro-EINS funding is available for students studying in EINS partner institutions. To qualify, a student must be a member of the EINS partner university and/or research center at the time of application.
</li>

<li>
ACM SIGCOMM GeoDiversity travel grants are available for attendees in their early career (at most five years of full-time, full-level, non-postdoc, post-PhD employment) from under-represented countries, based on need, distance to the conference venue, and impact of their attendance in increasing the diversity of conference participation.
</li>

<li>
There are a number of additional funding pending final decisions in the meantime we seek support for attendees across all categories.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Please consider the following important information before applying:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The application process is the same for all types of attendees and all sources of funding and is described in the rest of this page.
</li>
<li>
Travel grant awards are meant to "partially" cover the cost of attending and participating in SIGCOMM 2012. The only travel expenses that can be reimbursed are: air travel, hotel, and conference registration.
</li>
<li>
The exact number of awards will depend on the availability of funds and will be determined as funding amounts are finalized.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="hcls">Supporters</h2>
<p> ACM SIGCOMM thanks the following supporters, who make the 2012 student travel grants program possible:</p>

<h2 class="hcls">Selection Criteria</h2>

<p>The following criteria will be used in the selection process:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Preference will be given to applicants that do not present a paper in the conference. The rationale for this criterion is that the participation costs for a presenting author should be covered by their home institution.
</li>
<li>
Students presenting posters are encouraged to apply though. The rationale is to support the participation of students who do not present papers but contribute to the conference in other ways.
</li>
<li>
Evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience, will be required. Advanced students close to graduation or in the job market will also be given priority, when possible.
</li>
<li>
We also encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities. Special attention will be given to applicants from minority-serving institutions.
</li>
<li>
After giving priority to the above criteria, (co-)authors of papers may be considered but will be given lower priority. The rationale is to support people that contribute to the conference and cannot attend otherwise due to budget or other constraints. (An example is a student who is a second author but does not present and would not be able to attend the conference otherwise. Another example is a postdoc who presents work with a past affiliation or without affiliation and thus is not supported neither by its past nor by its current institution. In both cases, the applicant and the letter-writer should explain in their letters why it is impossible to support the applicant from other sources.)
</li>
</ol>
